# Connect AEGIS step by step

## 1. Start with live data and virtual funds

Run `make setup && make demo`, then open `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` for the original Command center and coin artwork. Choose **HSKSwap** in the workspace selector or open `/#/aegis` for HSKSwap. Its navigation uses the same backend session across screens; the existing network area also switches between workspaces. Refresh HSKSwap data, inspect the block and three pool links, and explicitly start the paper agent. No wallet, browser connection to HSKSwap, API key or faucet is needed for this path. Fresh data failure blocks fills and exposes unavailable valuation. Keep the backend bound to loopback and run one worker.

The original five strategy rules and configured selector now feed AEGIS through a [typed reference-market adapter](STRATEGY_CONNECTION.md). Normal library execution requires **Settings → Data providers → Coinbase**; synthetic fixtures cannot drive it. Configure the original strategies in the existing library and inspect their current HSKSwap execution/blocking reasons in **AEGIS → Trading Desk**. BTC/ETH map to WBTC/WETH; SOL has no verified HSKSwap mapping. The existing Krono SIMULATION and AEGIS PAPER ledgers are separate. The AWS tenant worker still uses Krono simulation; it does not run AEGIS or accept wallet keys. Do not change its mode/tenant schema to bypass this boundary.

## 2. Add the correct wallet network

Use an EVM account in Trust Wallet or another EVM wallet. The **public receive address** begins with `0x`; no recovery phrase or owner private key belongs in this project or chat. HashKey's [official network settings](https://docs.hskchain.net/docs/Build-on-HashKey-Chain/network-info) and the [verified local registry](../config/networks.yaml) are the sources for these values.

|                          | Testnet                                 | Mainnet                      |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Chain ID                 | 133                                     | 177                          |
| RPC                      | `https://testnet.hsk.xyz`               | `https://mainnet.hsk.xyz`    |
| Explorer                 | `https://testnet-explorer.hskchain.net` | `https://hsk.blockscout.com` |
| Native symbol            | HSK                                     | HSK                          |
| Discovered USDT decimals | **18**                                  | **6**                        |

Changing only an RPC URL is insufficient. The registry selects chain-specific contracts, pool addresses, token decimals and code pins. Startup and signing checks reject mismatched chains. Prefer testnet for deployment/funding proof. The official [faucet documentation](https://docs.hskchain.net/docs/Build-on-HashKey-Chain/Tools/Faucet) links to `https://faucet.hsk.xyz/faucet`, which redirects to `https://faucet.hskchain.net/faucet`. The documentation/redirect were checked; dispensing funds was not tested. Testnet HSK and synthetic trading tokens are separate assets.

## 3. Deploy and record the owner-bound vault

The testnet deployment is registered in `deployments/133.json`; its 0.05-HSK native deposit is confirmed. Use the README's `resume` command to wrap existing vault HSK if needed and finish the micro-swap proof, with no redeployment or new deposit. Public receipts and current balances are recorded in `docs/evidence/hsk-testnet-resume.json`.

Keep owner and agent addresses distinct. The supplied testnet profile uses local `hsk-owner` as owner/deployer and `hsk-agent` as the separate hot agent; a third deployer account is also supported. Owner signing stays in the local interactive Foundry process. A separately funded keeper is optional but needed for independent safety-exit availability. Follow [CONTRACTS.md](CONTRACTS.md) to prepare, simulate, broadcast to testnet and verify canonical deployment receipts. Only the recorder may create `deployments/133.json` after real code/ownership/binding checks. Local fork addresses never belong in that public registry. Mainnet deployment requires the user's separate explicit approval.

## 4. Connect and fund from the owner device

Open **Settings → More tools and setup → Wallet** to use the AEGIS owner panel in an EVM wallet browser or enable its browser extension. **Connect owner wallet** requests public account access. The wallet must be on the selected chain, and its account must match the registered owner. A standalone mobile WalletConnect QR integration is not configured or claimed.

Choose an operation and amount, then **Review owner transaction**. Inspect the fixed recipient and calldata. Confirm each step in the wallet. USDT uses an exact approval followed by a deposit; native HSK uses a native transfer followed by in-vault wrapping. Each step waits for a successful canonical receipt matching account, destination, calldata and value. Earlier successful steps remain if a later one is declined. Pending/uncertain activity survives browser reload and blocks a duplicate submission. An uncertain wallet response can be reconciled using its actual transaction hash.

Owner withdrawals always pay the registered owner. Native withdrawal uses unwrapped HSK; the contract also supports owner withdrawal of WHSK and other held ERC-20s through its verified interface. Ownership cannot transfer or renounce. Funding does not start trading. Review caps and deliberately unpause the real vault separately. The local PAPER agent remains a different ledger.

Actual Trust Wallet browser signing remains unvalidated. Public contract deployment and the CLI owner deposit are confirmed. Browser tests use an isolated wallet fixture; Python transaction encoding and receipt matching are separately tested.

## 5. Optional AI providers and Telegram

Copy `.env.example` to an ignored `.env` if needed. For Claude set `AEGIS_LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic`, your local `AEGIS_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and an explicit model ID available to your account in `AEGIS_ANTHROPIC_MODEL`. Restart `make demo`. The floating assistant button or Ctrl/Cmd+K opens the same assistant from every HSKSwap screen; **Strategies** shows the resulting validated preferences. Provider failures are reported honestly; a failure after a tool mutation does not repeat that mutation. No model credentials means the explicitly labeled deterministic language router is used. See the [official Python SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python) and [tool schema documentation](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/define-tools).

The same validated tools also support OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions (`AEGIS_LLM_PROVIDER=openai`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, explicit `AEGIS_OPENAI_MODEL`, optional `AEGIS_OPENAI_BASE_URL`) Groq (`AEGIS_LLM_PROVIDER=groq`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, optional `AEGIS_GROQ_MODEL`, default `openai/gpt-oss-120b`, rate-limit fallback `AEGIS_GROQ_FALLBACK_MODEL` default `openai/gpt-oss-20b`), and AWS Bedrock Converse (`AEGIS_LLM_PROVIDER=bedrock`, `AEGIS_BEDROCK_MODEL`, `AEGIS_BEDROCK_REGION`, local AWS credential chain). Set `AEGIS_LLM_FALLBACKS=openai,bedrock` for ordered fallback, or opt in to `auto` to try configured Anthropic, Groq, OpenAI and Bedrock providers. Failover is permitted only before a tool starts; validation refusals and uncertain mutations are never retried at another provider. The badge says Ready until an actual validated model tool runs, Active afterward, and Deterministic Fallback when no provider is active. These adapters have protocol tests; credential-backed delivery remains unverified.

`get_portfolio_and_pnl`, `update_strategy_config`, `explain_latest_decision`, `trigger_emergency_panic` and `request_close_all` share runtime state with the UI. Position budget changes require fresh NAV and remain within 10%. The default 100-USDT ledger refuses the 25-USDT chip atomically; 8 USDT is a valid example. Frequency changes polling (15–300 seconds), without increasing the six-trades/hour cap. Active-strategy filters preserve original rules and safety exits. A close request only prepares a preview; the model cannot confirm it. A preference change that affects open positions also returns a preview that only a human confirms (see [changing settings while the agent runs](AEGIS_FLOWS.md#changing-settings-while-the-agent-runs)). `rollback_params` restores a recorded settings version; `set_strategy_selector` and `update_library_strategy` change the selector and validated library strategy parameters through the backend, which versions them and invalidates in-flight library snapshots. Deterministic examples: "Use risk per trade 0.5%", "Auto-derisk at 1% daily loss", "Switch the strategy selector to consensus mode", "Set momentum fast period to 10", "Revert settings to version 3".

For Telegram, create a bot through Telegram's official BotFather, configure its token and your positive private-chat user ID in `AEGIS_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` / `AEGIS_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`, and set a strong `TERMINAL_API_TOKEN` for the local API. Restart the backend with that token. Start the separate bridge with environment variables loaded:

```bash
UV_CACHE_DIR="$PWD/.cache/uv" uv run --frozen --no-sync --env-file .env python -m aegis.nl.telegram_bot
```

Only that private chat and sender are accepted; foreign chats/groups receive no reply. `/status`, `/positions`, `/pnl`, `/decisions`, `/pause`, `/resume`, `/close`, `/panic` and free text share the same bounded paper tools. `/close` returns a one-use confirmation button. Bot updates are persisted before mutations to prevent replay after an uncertain outcome. Loopback HTTP or HTTPS is required for bearer credentials. See [Telegram's API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api). Real model requests and Telegram delivery require credentials and have not been validated in this session.

## 6. Independent safety and verification

Once a public registry exists, `make keeper ARGS='--network testnet --once'` reads actual contract-triggered safety exits without signing. A real keeper additionally requires a separate process-local `AEGIS_KEEPER_KEY` and `--execute`; mainnet also requires `--i-understand-live`. The keeper never receives vault proceeds. Keep its journal private and never share its gas account with another nonce writer. See [recovery commands and constraints](CONTRACTS.md).

The public decision verifier requires the chain, decision ID and actual reveal transaction. It checks deployed code, commitment, exact payload hash, canonical receipt and confirmation depth before showing a linked badge. Public testnet decisions #1 and #2 are confirmed: an unused stale-quote skip and a consumed guarded-swap lifecycle. [The contract guide](CONTRACTS.md#both-public-decisions) provides both receipt sets and read-only verification commands. A verified byte commitment does not prove a truthful rationale or a profit; paper feed items remain local records.
