# Krono (AEGIS)

**Research, automate and verify HSKSwap trading on HashKey Chain.**

Built for the **HashKey Chain Horizon Hackathon · AI Agent Trading** track, Krono brings a crypto research workspace together with AEGIS: an autonomous market-monitoring, signal, risk and execution loop for HSKSwap. Users inspect positions and P&L, adjust strategies through conversation, and trace decisions from observed data to execution.

The original research home, coin artwork and strategy library remain available. The default AEGIS dashboard uses **live mainnet data with virtual funds in PAPER mode**. Its separate signed gateway has completed a **public HashKey testnet commit → guarded swap → reveal** lifecycle.

**Start without keys:** `make setup && make demo`. Open the [research home](http://127.0.0.1:5173/), then switch to [AEGIS · HSKSwap](http://127.0.0.1:5173/#/aegis).

**Execution scope:** the website's autonomous loop uses paper funds. The signed gateway and public testnet proof are separate from that scheduler. The configured pool graph currently has no closed arbitrage cycle, and reference-market spreads are observations without a funded second leg. Starting the agent therefore does not guarantee a signal or a fill. The [current integration audit](docs/VERIFICATION.md#current-integration-audit) distinguishes working flows from the remaining signed-automation work.

## Start the project

Requires **Python 3.12, uv and Node.js 22.12+**. Setup installs locked dependencies into the project environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vishal88736/automatic-trading-agent.git
cd automatic-trading-agent
make setup
make demo
```

The frontend runs at **http://127.0.0.1:5173** and the API at **http://127.0.0.1:8787**. `make demo` starts both. Keep the terminal running; Ctrl+C stops them. Restart after backend source or environment changes.

No wallet, gas or model API key is needed for the default paper workflow. To configure optional providers, copy `.env.example` to your local ignored `.env`; the launcher loads it. Saved **Settings → Data providers** take precedence after initial startup.

### Begin with the research website

The home page retains the coin artwork, market watch, price charts and strategy cards. Use **Strategy Lab** for configurations and available chronological backtests, **News Intelligence** for source-linked context, and **Agent Observatory** for recorded stages, signals and consolidated risk decisions.

Select an asset and use **Analyze BTC** (or the selected asset) to record a research cycle. Reference data carries its source and freshness state; backtests disclose fees, slippage and holdout assumptions. Optional bull/bear LLM research requires a configured provider. Unavailable or fixture data stays labeled.

In **Agent Observatory**, open **Read evidence report** for a structured brief of that cycle: calculated technical indicators, recorded news sources, optional model debate, rule agreement, requested/approved sizing, stop estimate, risk checks and execution state. Publisher links and timestamps are captured with new runs. Older runs that retained only news IDs explicitly show that citation gap. The browser checks the report's SHA-256 receipt against both the exact payload and the displayed data; this verifies **local snapshot integrity**.

**News Intelligence** supports search, asset/category filters, source details, latest/breaking feeds and manual refresh. Refresh failures keep cached stories marked stale and offer retry. A read-only check on **3 November 2026** returned three latest stories under the provider's free allowance and ten breaking stories. Allowances and availability are shown from the API response.

News loads independently of the shared dashboard. It needs **no AI API key**: `NEWS_PROVIDER=cryptocurrency.cv` uses the provider's public allowance. An optional server-side `NEWS_API_KEY` uses your authorized news-provider plan. Saved **Settings → Data providers** controls which feed is active. Filters search the retrieved stories; an empty HSK filter means no matching story was supplied.

Use the **Execution workspace** selector to switch to **HSKSwap · AEGIS paper**. Research and AEGIS retain separate balances and ledgers. The [demo script](docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md) opens with this research walkthrough before the HSKSwap flow.

### Start automatic HSKSwap trading

1. Open `/#/aegis`. The app reads live pool data on its own, even while the agent is stopped (read-only: it cannot trade until you start it); **Refresh HSKSwap data** runs a full strategy check immediately.
2. Inspect the observed block, pool data, mode and **Closed-Loop Pipeline & Risk Status**.
3. Open **Strategies**, choose targets and entry strategies, and save preferences.
4. Click **Start paper agent**. The loop then monitors and evaluates at the configured interval without further clicks.
5. Inspect **Positions**, **Execution History** and **Agent Observatory** for fills, P&L and rejection reasons.

Entry checkboxes and library engines are separate controls. **Strategy engines** shows current readiness and provides versioned enable/disable buttons for supported engines. A checked entry displays its disabled/unavailable blocker explicitly. Arbitrage Detection remains unavailable until its required executable legs are configured. Target filters are checked before entry analysis and again before filling, including intermediate assets in a cycle; removing an asset keeps its protective exit rules active.

**Entries need a pool that trades.** If a pool's recorded mid price has not moved for 15 minutes, it has had no swaps: a fill there only pays the round-trip LP fee and price impact, and its stop-loss/take-profit can never trigger. AEGIS marks such pools **Inactive pool · entries blocked** on the market cards and refuses new entries there (exits are never blocked); a pool not yet observed long enough shows **Checking pool activity**. One library strategy also holds at most one position at a time, so a single signal cannot open several correlated bets. New ledgers start with V3 arbitrage and spread research switched off, because neither has an executable route today; they can still be enabled explicitly. Unmapped reference assets such as SOL are no longer evaluated.

A new AEGIS ledger starts with **100 virtual USDT** and entries paused. Fills, holdings, preferences, position timers and risk baselines persist. Every restart pauses new entries; a latched emergency remains active until reviewed. PANIC blocks entries and requests bounded stable exits, subject to fresh quotes and risk checks.

### Permanent local trade history

Open **Execution History → Past trades** in Research or **Paper execution ledger** in AEGIS. Search receipts, strategies or sources; filter by asset, side and UTC dates; page through all retained fills. **View details** shows exact amounts, original quotes and V3 telemetry, captured execution settings, related audit events, and retained research/news citations. **Download trade evidence** exports that individual record as JSON. Analysis, HOLD decisions and rejected previews remain in their decision feeds and do not appear as completed trades.

The authoritative SQLite files are `.runtime/terminal.sqlite3` for Research simulation and `.runtime/aegis-paper.sqlite3` for AEGIS paper. `TERMINAL_DB` and `AEGIS_DB` can select other local paths. The accounts stay separate. Existing fills are retained across restarts without the dashboard's recent-row limit; older records explicitly identify missing settings snapshots instead of borrowing today's configuration.

```bash
make db-init    # Create missing schemas; retain existing funds, settings and history
make db-status  # Read-only SQLite integrity and record counts
make db-backup  # Private, verified snapshots under .runtime/backups/
```

Backups use SQLite's backup API so committed WAL data is included while the app runs. Database files and their WAL/SHM sidecars are ignored by Git. Keys and signer journals are kept outside these browser exports. On-chain proofs remain in the separate public verifier and deployment evidence.

### Trading sessions

Open **Sessions** in the left sidebar (Research or AEGIS). Every run of the agent from **Start** to **Pause / PANIC / restart** is one session, rebuilt from the permanent ledger, so earlier runs stay available after restarts. A session shows its net P&L against the starting portfolio value, the NAV chart with each buy/sell marked, a step-by-step story of what the agent did (price, amount, strategy, confidence and reason at that moment), every position paired with its exit, and the settings in force when it started. Exits that settle after the stop, such as a PANIC unwind, belong to the session that opened them. `GET /api/aegis/sessions` and `/api/aegis/sessions/{id}` serve the same read-only data.

### Inspect the executable market details

Open **AEGIS → Markets**, select WHSK, WETH or WBTC, and choose **Inspect executable routes**. The read-only inspector compares verified QuoterV2 routes for the current entry budget at a single observed block. It shows quoted output, the modeled paper fill floor, LP fees, price impact, gas units, expiry, target/pause state and quote preflight results. Expand a route for its exact token amounts, pool addresses, `sqrtPriceX96`, tick, liquidity and fee tiers. Expired quotes lose their quoted status; changing the asset or settings clears the prior inspection.

Quote inspection leaves balances, preferences, decisions and fills unchanged. LP fees are included once in QuoterV2 output. Additional paper slippage and the USDT network expense are labeled models; gas units alone are not an actual transaction fee. Portfolio, signal and execution gates retain their existing authority.

### Reference-inspired detail views

The structured research and market-detail patterns were informed by [Omega AI](https://github.com/ansu555/omega-ai-app/tree/88f843657cdfa73366263b8cd0ae394931e9930f). They are implemented independently in Krono's existing stack and screens:

| Reference pattern                           | Krono implementation                                                                                                        | Existing view                                     |

The research home and artwork, strategy library, adaptive controls, conversational tools, Telegram adapter, AWS workspace and signed Guard/DecisionLog flow remain available. Public-chain verification continues to use the separate contract evidence below.

Live-data captures: [research evidence report](docs/evidence/screenshots/research-brief-desktop.png) and [HSKSwap route details](docs/evidence/screenshots/hskswap-route-details-desktop.png).

## Conversational control and running-strategy changes

The same validated controls serve web chat and the optional private Telegram adapter. Example requests:

- **Show my open positions and real-time P&L.**
- **Set position size to 8 USDT and frequency to 45s.** On a fresh 100-USDT ledger this fits the reviewed 10% ceiling; lower NAV can require a smaller budget.
- **Switch risk appetite to conservative with a 1.5% stop-loss.**
- **Focus target assets on WHSK and WETH.**
- **Explain the latest decision.**
- **Pause**, **PANIC**, or **close all positions**. Closing produces a separate human-confirmed preview.

An out-of-range request such as **25 USDT on 100 USDT NAV** is refused; the chat's size shortcut is calculated from the current NAV so it always fits. Risk presets apply bounded settings, and explicit values in the same request take precedence. Monitoring frequency does not override trade-frequency caps.

The bounded AEGIS command router works without a key. It supports **“Pause the agent”**, **“Stop trading WETH”**, portfolio/P&L questions and last-trade explanations. Current target assets are WHSK/WETH/WBTC with USDT settlement and a 15–300 second scan interval. USDC settlement, a ten-minute scan interval and changing the minimum spread threshold are explicitly refused; mixed requests are validated before any setting changes.

Running-strategy controls include:

- **Impact previews:** changes affecting existing holdings show the affected positions and require a one-use, expiring human confirmation.
- **Exit-rule scope:** apply reviewed exit changes to existing positions or retain their prior rules for new-entry-only changes.
- **Optional follow-up actions:** a confirmed change can request exits for removed targets or trim oversized holdings through the normal bounded gateway.
- **Settings history and rollback:** retained versions can be restored through the same validation and impact-review path.
- **Adaptive sizing:** optional risk-per-trade sizing and regime scaling can reduce the configured entry budget. NAV and absolute-USDT caps remain ceilings.
- **Guarded daily-loss trigger:** an optional threshold below the circuit breaker tightens settings toward the conservative preset.

Typed updates and their diffs are recorded in the local paper audit trail. These controls do not change on-chain Guard caps. Implementation: [runtime](agent/aegis/runtime.py), [policy](agent/aegis/risk/policy.py), [chat tools](agent/aegis/nl/tools.py) and [live-change tests](agent/tests/test_live_changes.py).

```

The AI interprets intent and explains retrieved evidence. Deterministic calculations and risk checks decide execution eligibility. Models receive no wallet keys, cannot construct raw transactions or raise Guard caps, and cannot confirm their own close or settings previews. Provider fallback stops once a tool starts, preventing repeated mutations.

## Strategies, risk and accounting

The interface retains **seven entry selections**: two native HSKSwap strategies and the five-strategy research library. Their data sources and eligibility differ:

| Strategy                              | Input / execution boundary                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pool mean reversion                   | Observed HSKSwap pool-price history; requires warmup and a cost-adjusted deviation                                                                                            |
| V3 arbitrage                          | Actual executable closed routes returning to the starting token; net output must cover costs                                                                                  |
| Momentum Trading                      | Reference-market EMA, MACD, RSI and volume rules; eligible mapped entries pass HSKSwap quote/risk checks                                                                      |
| Mean reversion                        | Reference-market Bollinger/RSI and range filters; the same guarded paper gateway                                                                                              |

| Breakout Trading                      | Prior-window channel, ATR buffer and volume confirmation                                                                                                                      |
| Arbitrage Detection / spread research | Retained research evaluator; currently ineligible for standalone execution without compatible executable-route support. Native V3 scanning handles closed-route opportunities |

The [typed bridge](backend/aegis_bridge.py) maps **BTC → WBTC** and **ETH → WETH**. SOL remains available for research and has no verified HSKSwap execution mapping. A library entry must meet the research configuration, AEGIS selection, mapped target, source freshness and final quote/risk checks. A checked entry preference does not supply missing market data or make an unsupported route executable. [Strategy rules](docs/STRATEGIES.md) and [connection details](docs/STRATEGY_CONNECTION.md) describe these boundaries.

Reviewed paper ceilings include **10% NAV per fill**, **three concurrent holdings**, **30% aggregate exposure**, **six fills/hour**, **20/day** and a **30-second entry cooldown**. Stop-loss, take-profit, ATR, trailing and time exits complement the **2% daily-loss** and **10% drawdown** circuit breakers. Signed execution independently checks actual deployed limits; the owner can only tighten contract caps. See [risk semantics](docs/RISK.md).

QuoterV2 output already includes LP fees and tick-crossing impact. Paper fills add disclosed modeled slippage and network expense; those costs are not measured public gas fees. Signed execution reconciles actual receipts and credited output. Stale/RPC failures block fills and mask current valuation.

### Why no trade may occur

Pool mean reversion needs at least 20 distinct-block observations. Library strategies require fresh reference prices, sufficient closed hourly history and their configured entry/selection conditions. An executable arbitrage cycle may be absent or unprofitable after costs. Liquidity, impact, exposure, cooldown, loss limits, pause or emergency state can also block a fill. The Observatory records those reasons.

Reference-feed/DEX spreads remain informational without an executable second leg and complete settlement costs. The system does not force entries to make a demonstration move. Recorded paper round trips, replay fixtures and testnet exits establish behavior; **sustained profitability is not claimed**.

## Public HashKey testnet proof

The public registry records all three modules on **chain 133**:

Decision #1's quote was **57 seconds old** against a **20-second TTL**. The off-chain freshness gate rejected the swap; the on-chain reveal proves the exact unused commitment. Vault token balances were unchanged, while the agent paid commitment/reveal gas.

Decision #2 swapped **0.005 WHSK** into **0.270119936641739849 testnet USDT** and revealed **2,398 exact bytes**, with `consumed_by_vault: true` and `output_delta_raw: 0`. This is zero additional output delta against the recorded executable quote; its quoted fees and impact still apply. Receipt-reported lifecycle fees were **0.000695370676003869 HSK**. This was a bounded testnet stable exit.

[Deployment evidence](docs/evidence/hsk-onchain-deployment.json), [resume verification](docs/evidence/hsk-testnet-resume.json), and [deployments/133.json](deployments/133.json) retain the addresses, receipts, code pins and verification scope. A separate oversized-order `eth_call` checked the deployed `TradeLimit()` rejection; it was not a mined circuit-breaker transaction.

Verify the recorded decisions without unlocking a wallet or sending a transaction:

```bash

```

### Signed execution and deployment

The browser workflow remains PAPER. Signed execution uses a separate funded agent and an explicitly authorized CLI. The vault fixes the router, allowed assets and vault recipient; only the owner can withdraw to the owner. The owner key stays on the owner's device or in their local keystore.

The recorded proof is complete and needs no new deployment, deposit, wrap or swap. Recovery reuses the existing registry and signer journal. For deployment, recovery, source verification and keeper operation, follow [CONTRACTS.md](docs/CONTRACTS.md) and [CONNECTIONS.md](docs/CONNECTIONS.md).

Configured networks are **177 / `https://mainnet.hsk.xyz`** and **133 / `https://testnet.hsk.xyz`**. Verified token addresses and decimals come from [config/networks.yaml](config/networks.yaml); testnet USDT has 18 decimals and mainnet USDT has six. Testnet receipt verification stays on the pinned RPC and gives inconsistent node views a bounded reconciliation window. Project-local tools come from `make contracts-setup`.

### Hackathon testnet and faucet plan

The organizer faucet guide supplied by the project owner permits smart-contract development/testing on HashKey testnet and Ethereum Sepolia, and describes mainnet migration after the hackathon. Under that guide, the current demonstration can use testnet funds. A mainnet deployment is not a prerequisite for this testnet demonstration.

| Purpose                                | Network                     | Krono configuration                                                                                                                                      |

| HSKSwap market observations            | HashKey mainnet · 177       | Read-only pool data and quotes; the paper account uses virtual funds.                                                                                    |
| Public guarded execution               | HashKey testnet · 133       | Existing Vault, Oracle, DecisionLog and verified swap proof. Test HSK pays gas; the recorded route uses WHSK/testnet USDT.                               |
| Optional official USDC payment testing | Ethereum Sepolia · 11155111 | Allowed by the supplied guide. Circle test USDC and Sepolia ETH belong to this separate network; Sepolia execution is not currently configured in Krono. |

Circle lists Ethereum Sepolia USDC at **`0x1c7D4B196Cb0C7B01d743Fbc6116a902379C7238`** in its [official contract directory](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/usdc-contract-addresses). Select **USDC → Ethereum Sepolia** at the [Circle faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/) for that optional payment test. HashKey's [network documentation](https://docs.hskchain.net/docs/Build-on-HashKey-Chain/network-info) confirms testnet chain 133 and links its test-HSK faucet instructions.

Run `make testnet-funding` before `make demo-testnet`. It reads (never signs) the registered owner, agent and Guard Vault balances on chain 133, the vault pause state, and prints the faucet step for each gap. Add `ARGS="--sepolia 0xYourWallet"` to also read Sepolia ETH and Circle test USDC for a wallet.

**Claiming test funds:**

1. **Test HSK (HashKey testnet gas):** add HashKey testnet (chain 133, RPC `https://testnet.hsk.xyz`) to your wallet, open the [HashKey faucet](https://faucet.hsk.xyz/faucet), paste the address and claim. Fund the **agent** address for commit/swap/reveal gas and the **owner** for deposits and pause/resume.
2. **Vault funds:** the faucet only dispenses HSK. Deposit and wrap HSK into the vault from **AEGIS → Wallet** (owner), then convert part to testnet USDT through a bounded exit ([CONTRACTS.md](docs/CONTRACTS.md)). Resume the vault from the same panel.
3. **Circle test USDC (optional, Ethereum Sepolia):** switch the wallet to Sepolia, open the [Circle faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/), choose **USDC → Ethereum Sepolia**, paste the address and click **Send USDC**. Claim [Sepolia ETH](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia) for gas. Sepolia is a separate network; Krono does not trade there.

Testnet tokens have no monetary value. Never paste a private key into a faucet or chat.

The guide does not require adding USDC payments to the AI Agent Trading project. Our primary signed test target remains the existing HashKey deployment. `make demo-testnet` runs the website's autonomous loop with signed settlement: the same strategies, risk gates and chat controls, with every fill a commit → guarded Guard Vault swap → reveal on chain 133 ([testnet runtime](agent/aegis/testnet/runtime.py)). It starts paused, unlocks only the registered agent keystore at a local prompt, mirrors vault receipts in its own database and refuses to start if the vault holds no testnet USDT. The owner must also resume the vault. This scheduler is covered by local tests with a fake signer; a sustained run against chain 133 is not yet recorded. Every signed testnet trade must use a fresh quote and risk checks from chain 133.

Mainnet deployment and signing require separate owner authorization and **`--broadcast --i-understand-live`**. No public mainnet deployment or autonomous signed-entry scheduler is claimed. A local-fork run from `make verify-signed-fork` has local receipts and no public explorer transactions.

## AI providers and Telegram

Copy `.env.example` to ignored `.env`, configure the selected provider and restart:

**A newcomer can use the platform through the assistant alone.** Ask in your own words, including Hinglish:

- **What should I do next?** Guidance from your real state (no data yet, ready, holding, running or stopped).
- **How does this work? / What is a stop-loss?** Plain explanations of the workflow, strategies, risk, pools, costs and modes.
- **Why is it not trading?** Every recorded blocker, plus what each strategy decided.
- **How is my current session going? / Show session 2 / Analyze my past sessions.** Results, decisions with prices and reasons, totals by strategy, asset and exit reason, and how much of a result was market movement versus trading cost.
- **Buy 2 USDT of WHSK / Sell half of WETH.** The assistant prepares a preview with amounts, costs, stops and warnings. **Only a person can confirm it in the dialog**: the model never receives the confirmation token. Size, exposure, cooldown and trade-rate limits still apply. A pause does not block a confirmed trade; the emergency stop does. A quiet pool blocks the agent's automatic entries but only warns on a trade you review. A result more than 0.5% worse than previewed is refused.

Recognized questions read recorded data directly and the model only phrases the answer, so they stay correct and still answer when the provider is unavailable. The browser sends the last few turns so follow-ups make sense; the server does not store them. Research **Ask Krono** keeps its key-free commands and shares this guidance and session knowledge; trades happen in the AEGIS workspace.

| AWS Bedrock            | `AEGIS_LLM_PROVIDER=bedrock`, `AEGIS_BEDROCK_MODEL`, `AEGIS_BEDROCK_REGION`, local AWS credentials/profile                                                                                    |

Use a tool-capable model available to your account. The UI distinguishes readiness, **Active (Tool-Calling)** after successful tool use, and **Deterministic Fallback**. A provider failure after a tool starts retains the tool result and does not replay the mutation. Actual model entitlement and external delivery require credentials.

For Groq, create a key at [console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys), set `GROQ_API_KEY` in your local `.env` (`AEGIS_LLM_PROVIDER=groq` is already selected there), then restart `make demo`. Groq uses the same OpenAI-compatible tool-calling adapter and validated tools. Groq's free tier limits tokens per minute per model (8000 for `openai/gpt-oss-120b`); a short limit is waited out automatically, a longer one hands the turn to `AEGIS_GROQ_FALLBACK_MODEL`, and only if both are limited is the reason shown in the chat reply. Give research its own `RESEARCH_MODEL` (for example `qwen/qwen3.8-27b`) so it does not share the chat budget. Groq retires models over time; `GET https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/models` lists the current ones.

For Anthropic, set `AEGIS_LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `AEGIS_ANTHROPIC_MODEL` in your local `.env`, then restart `make demo`. Keep API keys, wallet keys and passwords out of chat and Git.

Telegram is opt-in: configure `AEGIS_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, the owner's private `AEGIS_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`, `TERMINAL_API_TOKEN` and `AEGIS_API_URL`, then run `make telegram` with those variables loaded. The adapter uses the same authenticated paper API and human-confirmation boundary. Never put wallet keys or passwords in chat.

## Validation and submission material

The **3 November 2026** integration validation passed **449 Python tests plus 10 subtests**, **52 browser tests**, Ruff, formatting, generated source-reference checks and the frontend production build. The Guard suite has **57 passing Solidity tests**. SQLite archive/backup tests and production restart checks also pass. The normal Python suite skips one explicitly opt-in live connector test; the Solidity suite skips its opt-in live-fork test. See the [integration validation](docs/evidence/integration-repair-validation.json) for changed files and exact scope; the earlier [frontend/reference validation](docs/evidence/frontend-reference-validation.json) remains a historical record.

Separate live checks verified source-backed research/news in Chromium, including latest/breaking feeds, filters, publisher links, manual refresh and seven screen widths. Earlier read-only mainnet route checks for **WHSK, WETH and WBTC** retain their own recorded blocks. These UI checks used isolated virtual ledgers, invoked no models and sent **zero transactions**. Public decision #2's exact revealed hash, 2,398 payload bytes and vault-consumption flag were also rechecked read-only; the historical swap accounting remains scoped to its original evidence. None of these checks establishes profitability.

Browser tests use an isolated, labeled fixture API. Explicit network checks and signed fork checks are opt-in; [VERIFICATION.md](docs/VERIFICATION.md) documents their scope. The earlier [submission report](docs/evidence/hackathon-upgrade-validation.json) records **15/15 checkpoints passed within that report's stated scopes**. Its test totals, browser captures and earlier soak belong to their recorded revisions.
